final JSON should be list of all entries with catgroups used to create these
fields:
  top cat: applicance
  sub cat: type
  sub-sub cat: subtype
  etc..?


on my way with this:
  create a class to rep all objects from xml
  it won't be SOLID OOP, all data will just be accessible via properties
  but it will also have getParent()/getChildren() for stuff that's hierarchical
  like cats and products, to give easy reference while building json but avoid
  redundant data

figure out how to automatically trim all xml values! at least by default

how to handle hierarchy of catalogentries (products with 'parentpartnumber')?
  only show top level? or only bottom level?
  why are there levels? are they like additional categories?
