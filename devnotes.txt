top cat: applicance
sub cat: type
sub-sub cat: subtype
etc..?


create a class to rep all objects from xml
it won't be SOLID OOP, all data will just be accessible via properties
but it will also have getParent()/getChildren() for stuff that's hierarchical
like cats and products, to give easy reference while building json but avoid
redundant data
