# TODO

* maybe pull microwaves with hoods into hoods category for WP, but wait for go-ahead
    - see https://trello.com/c/S2QpSUyk/11-microwavehoodcombination
    - and https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/15112ae69be782f2
* error logging
* don't keep trying to process if a file is missing
* for staging:
    - later maybe - put zend app dirs in proper structure so only public is exposed (currently just using .htaccess with Order directive to limit access to public/)
