# TODO

* group WP only (leave KAD) cooking appliances under "Cooking" with "type" property for the actual category - like MTG
    + probably - see email https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/150ded4b87d56e6c
* filter out ice makers from fridges using `SC_Kitchen_Refrigeration_Refrigerators_Ice_Makers` - wait for go ahead to do same for blowers from hoods using `SC_Kitchen_Cooking_Hoods_Liners__Blowers`
* sales feature assocs for WP
* xdebug profile to look for memory hogging parts
* don't keep trying to process if a file is missing
* for staging:
    - later maybe - put zend app dirs in proper structure so only public is exposed
