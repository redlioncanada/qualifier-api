More questions for RLC/WP, since 25 Jun:

Prices:

- listprice or saleprice?
- published=0 or price=0 mean exclude product. what if we're not in date range for price? exclude product or just don't include that price (prob meaning price would be null for that variant)
- londescription typo in new verison?



===========

  DESCRIPTIVE ATTRS APPLY TO TOP-LEVEL ENTRIES ONLY
  correspondingly, defining attrs apply to child entries only
    defining attrs are just colours - does this mean child entries are just
    colour vars? yes apparently from below

  are there >2 levels of cat entries?
    I doubt it, it seems the sub-entries are JUST colour variations!
    this is true across the board, all brands, all cat groups.
    maybe we can just ignore all child entries for the purpose of WPQ?
    check if there are >2 lvls. NO! only 2. phew.
    so basically, based on actual usage of this very abstract schema, 2nd-level
      products and their corresponding "defining attrs" are only for color
      variations. --> so check w Bianca if we care about colours at all. if not,
      can just use top level products and ignore defining attrs.

      if so, it's a bit complicated. i'll process all catalog entries, then
      attach the child entries to the parents, and then synthesize all that
      into colour variants in the API output.



why do defining attribute values have parent part number?
  i think just not normalized, probably can ignore

should defining attr values be attached to defining attrs or cat entries?
  maybe should just attach values directly to entries, not sure attr provides
  anything i need

also, defining attrs for mtg at least are just colour. what about other brands? yep, all just color
