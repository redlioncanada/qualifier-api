laundry pairs logic:

What I want is to associate top-level parts whenever >=1 of their children are associated.
  --> what level is the pic on?
    pics are descriptive attributes in the gallery group. each attr pertains to one
    image of the gallery, and contains the urls to usually 3 different sizes, with '|' separator

    there's no meta info, just a list of URLs. so have to rely on 'pair_' being part
    of the url to find pair images. i guess use the 1st matching url, of the medium size

Actually, more accurately I want to go through all top level parts in laundry pairs, and
on finding a child associated to another child,
  get the parent of the assoced child
  create a key (alpha order of cur sku to assoc parent sku)
  create a new 'pair' record with that key - b/c of alpha ordering, reverse assoc
    won't be counted as a separate record.
  the pair record will have flat combined list of all washer and dryer features

other pics:

  and for images for non-laundry, just use the <fullimage> elmt of main entry record - they all have one

they're all relative to maytag.com/digitalassets

- for staging:
  - later maybe - put zend app dirs in proper structure so only public is exposed

top cats in FE:

laundry
cooking
  free standing range
  wall ovens
  (
    vent hoods - unconfirmed so ignore for now
    we're not doing cooktops
  )
fridge

More questions for RLC/WP, since 25 Jun:

Prices:

- listprice or saleprice?
- published=0 or price=0 mean exclude product. what if we're not in date range for price? exclude product or just don't include that price (prob meaning price would be null for that variant)
- londescription typo in new verison?



===========

  DESCRIPTIVE ATTRS APPLY TO TOP-LEVEL ENTRIES ONLY
  correspondingly, defining attrs apply to child entries only
    defining attrs are just colours - does this mean child entries are just
    colour vars? yes apparently from below

  are there >2 levels of cat entries?
    I doubt it, it seems the sub-entries are JUST colour variations!
    this is true across the board, all brands, all cat groups.
    maybe we can just ignore all child entries for the purpose of WPQ?
    check if there are >2 lvls. NO! only 2. phew.
    so basically, based on actual usage of this very abstract schema, 2nd-level
      products and their corresponding "defining attrs" are only for color
      variations. --> so check w Bianca if we care about colours at all. if not,
      can just use top level products and ignore defining attrs.

      if so, it's a bit complicated. i'll process all catalog entries, then
      attach the child entries to the parents, and then synthesize all that
      into colour variants in the API output.



why do defining attribute values have parent part number?
  i think just not normalized, probably can ignore

should defining attr values be attached to defining attrs or cat entries?
  maybe should just attach values directly to entries, not sure attr provides
  anything i need

also, defining attrs for mtg at least are just colour. what about other brands? yep, all just color
